There are two more preprocessor directives available, though they are
not very commonly used. They are:
(a) #undef
(b) #pragma

### #undef directive

On some occasions, it may be desirable to cause a defined name to become 'undefined'. This can be accomplished by means of the #undef directive.


### #pragma directive

This directive is another special-purpose directive that you can use to
turn on or off certain features. Pragmas vary from one compiler to another.o

see example pragma.c
