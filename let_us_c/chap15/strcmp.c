/* Function which compares two strings to find out whether they
 * are same or different. The two string are compared character-by-character
 * until there is a mismatch or end of one of the string is reached,
 * whichever occurs first.
 * If the two strings are identical, strcmp() returns a value zero.
 * If they're not, it returns the numeric difference between the ASCII values
 * of the first non-matching pair of characters.
