#### Compilers and Interpreters

__Interpreter__
> "when the program is executed, to take each line in turn, translate it into machine code and then run the machine code. When the translation of a line takes place, the resulting machine code overwrites that from the previous line, so that if a line of source code appear in a loop which is executed 200 times, it also must be translated 200 times"

__Compilers__
> "The obvious alternative is to translate the entire source code into a single machine code program, and then run the machine code. This will clearly execute faster, and there are no translations during execution. A translator that adopts this approach is called a compiler."

#### The Skeleton of a C program

> "All C programs consist of a series of functions"

> "The effective length of a function name is often six letters"

> "In C, the newline character has no significance at all"
