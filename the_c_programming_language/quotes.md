## The C programming Language, Kernighan & Ritchie (1978)

- Basics:
   - variables and constants
   -  arithmetic
   -  control flow
   -  functions
   -  rudiments of input and output.

- Writing bigger programs:
    - pointers
    - structures
    - rich set of operators
    - several control-flow statements
    - and the standard library.

##### Introduction

> "A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is called a character string or string constant"

> "An escape sequence like \n provides a general and extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters."

> "If an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an integer operation is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the interger will be converted to floating point before the operation is done."

> "In any context where it is permissible to use the value of some type, you can use a more complicated expression of that type."

> "A character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical value of the character in the machine's character set. This is called a character constant, although it is just another way to write a small integer"

##### Functions

> "With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore how a job is done; knowing what is done is sufficient"


##### Arguments - Call by Value

> "Call by value is an asset... It usually leads to more compact programs with fewer extraneous variables, because parameters can be treated as conveniently initialized local variables in the called routine."
