## The C programming Language, Kernighan & Ritchie (1978)

- basics: variables and constants, arithmetic, control flow, functions, rudiments of input and output.

- writing bigger programs: pointers, structures, rich set of operators, several control-flow statements, and the standard library.

> "A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is called a character string or string constant"

> "An escape sequence like \n provides a general and extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters."

> "If an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an integer operation is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the interger will be converted to floating point before the operation is done."

> "In any context where it is permissible to use the value of some type, you can use a more complicated expression of that type."

> "A character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical value of the character in the machine's character set. this is called a character constant, although it is just another way to writea small integer"

> "With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore how a job is done; knowing what is done is sufficient"
